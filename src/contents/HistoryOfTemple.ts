    "The Śrī Rāmachandra Temple is unlike any other. Its sanctum houses a rare and awe-inspiring ensemble of idols crafted from sacred śāligrāma śilā (black stones): Śrī Rāma, radiating dignity; Sītā, a beacon of compassion and strength; Lakṣmaṇa, symbolizing devotion; Bharata, embodying discipline; and Śatrughna, representing vigilance. Nearby, a majestic idol of Hanumān, the supreme devotee, stands with folded hands, inspiring unwavering faith. These idols are not mere sculptures but living symbols of values that guide human life—peace, prosperity, and harmony. They invite visitors to reflect on the timeless teachings of the Rāmāyaṇa, where Śrī Rāma’s life exemplifies duty, truth, and compassion.",
    "The temple is located in Battisputali, one kilometer southwest of the Pashupatinath temple. The Ram Mandir holds great importance among Hindus. A short flight of stairs from the entrance and leads to the temple. The architecture of Ram Mandir is in Royal Gombaz architecture and has a touch of the Mughal style architecture, due to the influence of the Mughal art and architecture in Nepal in the past.",
